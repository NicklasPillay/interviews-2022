Design Pattern which apps are broken down into smaller more focused and modular components/apps.
They communicate with each other to achieve a consolidated goal, but each targets an area to execute.

Easier to develop and test.
As well as maintain and deploy.
Easier to scale individual microservice.

Docker containers make it easier to use these.
How?
Via virtualization Docker spins up an instance, 
on top of the hardware and host O/S which can host any defined O/S, and apps.

Provides SOC and cleaner workspace.
