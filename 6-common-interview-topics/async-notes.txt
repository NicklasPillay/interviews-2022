Async

- do not block the calling thread
- returns a task
- task are the cornerstone of async programming
- task is not thread
- task is a specific process/piece of work to do
- Can check status of that task
- Can get result
- can schedule more work post completion with .ContinueWith()

eg. ReadAllLinesAync


Async and Await
- makes asynchrounous programming easy
- await will not block the CPU
- will go do other stuff/tasks/work
- once this task is completed, will continue doing work/tasks
